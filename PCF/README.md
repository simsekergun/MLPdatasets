### Photonic Crystal Fiber Dataset
This dataset is derived from the dataset used in {https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.036414}. If you have time, please read the paper. 



#### Features (Independent Variables): Physical properties of photonic crsytal fibers (PCFs)
- Number of the rings (between the inner core and outer core) 
- Air hole diameter
- Pitch length ($\mu$m)
- Radius of the fiber normalized by number of the rings ($\mu$/m). 		



####  Outputs (Dependent Variables): Optical properties of photonic crsytal fibers (PCFs)
- Effective index 
- Effective mode area 
- Dispersion, and 
- Confinement loss
