In this dataset we have 3531 lasers. 
The output power of the laser beam intensity is measured T hours after it starts lasing, 
where T = 2, 20, 40, 60 hours. 
We also know whether is made with material 1 or 2 and whether it has a heatsink or not. 
The last column indicates whether the laser still outputs a stable beam after 1000 hours of operation. 
Our goal is predicting this outcome from the short-term measuments (the first four column of the dataset), 
material type, and existence of heatsink.

Note: The first 4 columns of this dataset is taken from the dataset studied in https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02842.
Columns 4-7 are created by ES.
