### Differential reflectance dataset 
This dataset is taken from one of my earlier papers. 
Please read it, if you have time. Here's the \href{https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~simsek/journal_papers/j31_n_with_NN.pdf}{link} for an electronic copy of that paper. 

Figures below shows a typical reflectance measurement setup. 
The one on the top measures reflectance from a p-polarized laser, the one on the bottom from an s-polarized laser. 
Note that these letters have a German origin: s = senkrecht = perpendicular, p = parallel. 
It basically tells whether the electric field is perpendicular or parallel to the plane of incidence. 

The wavelength of the laser is 400 nm. We place a 0.7 nm thick film on a substrate whose complex refractive index is $\tilde{n} = n+ik$, where the real part $n$ is the refractive index and indicates the phase velocity, while the imaginary part $k$ is called the optical extinction coefficient or absorption coefficient. We work either with SiO$_2$-coated silicon substrates or glass substrates. We change the incidence angle ($\theta_{\mathrm{inc}}$) from 0 degrees to 60 degrees at a step of 1 degrees and we record the intensity of the reflected light with the help of a photodiode. When we use reflectance from the bare substrate as a reference, then we can get the differential reflectance by simply calculating $(\Gamma-\Gamma_0)/\Gamma_0$, where $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_0$ are the reflectances from the sample coated substrate and bare substrate.
